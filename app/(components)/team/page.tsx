                        During a train ride, a moment of inspiration struck Vasily. He wished for a convenient study
                        tool on his phone to help him prepare for the LSAT. However, such an app didnâ€™t exist at the
                        time. Determined to overcome this hurdle, Vasily took matters into his own hands and developed
                        one of the earliest and most comprehensive LSAT apps on the market. The app quickly gained
                        popularity, becoming the #1 paid LSAT app for over a year.
